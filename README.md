# Property Logs

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that automatically logs property changes in frontmatter with timestamps. Track status updates, deadline changes, priority shifts, and any other property mutations to build a rich audit trail for your notes.

## Features

- **Automatic property tracking** — Watch any frontmatter property for changes and automatically log them to a history array with timestamps
- **Flexible filtering** — Include/exclude specific folders and tags to control which notes are tracked
- **Smart deduplication** — Optionally skip logging duplicate status values or overwrite same-day entries
- **Comments** — Add timestamped comments to notes to annotate status history
- **Visual status charts** — Insert interactive charts that visualize how status evolved over time across multiple notes (requires [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [Obsidian Charts](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-charts))
- **Customizable keys** — Rename the history key and property names to match your vault's naming conventions
- **Multiple tracked properties** — Go beyond status—track deadline changes, priority updates, assignees, or any other property

## Use Cases

### Project & Task Management
- **Track project status evolution** — See how a project moved from Planned → Active → Completed with exact dates
- **Monitor milestone deadlines** — Log when deadlines shift, detect scope creep
- **Visualize team capacity** — Chart how many projects were Active, In Progress, or Blocked each month

### Content Management
- **Publishing workflow** — Track Draft → Review → Scheduled → Published with timestamps
- **Content priority tracking** — Monitor how content priorities changed before publication
- **Audience reach visualization** — Chart how many articles were Featured vs. Archived each period

### Knowledge Management
- **Note maturity tracking** — Watch notes progress from Seedling → Growing → Evergreen
- **Research status** — Monitor whether research topics are Exploring, Consolidating, or Complete
- **Learning progress** — Chart concept mastery levels over time

### OKR & Goal Tracking
- **Goal progress** — Log goal status changes (Planning → Active → Achieved → Archived)
- **Quarterly performance** — Visualize OKR completion rates per quarter
- **Initiative tracking** — Monitor initiatives across pipeline stages

### General Audit Trails
- **Change history** — Maintain a full audit trail of any property that matters to you
- **Decision documentation** — Log when decisions change status with optional comments
- **Compliance** — Create timestamped records of status/property changes for audit purposes

## How It Works

The plugin monitors your vault's metadata cache. When a property in a watched note changes, it automatically appends an entry to a configurable history array in the note's frontmatter. Only changes are logged—the first time a property is seen, it becomes the baseline.

### Example

A note with `status` changes might look like this:

```yaml
---
title: Launch new website
status: Active
color: blue
status_history:
  - dateSet: "2025-01-15"
    statusSet: Backlog
  - dateSet: "2025-02-20"
    statusSet: Active
---
```

If you track additional properties (e.g., `deadline`), changed values appear in the same history entry:

```yaml
---
title: Launch new website
status: Active
deadline: "2025-04-30"
status_history:
  - dateSet: "2025-01-15"
    statusSet: Backlog
  - dateSet: "2025-02-20"
    statusSet: Active
    deadlineSet: "2025-04-30"
  - dateSet: "2025-02-28"
    comment: "Deadline extended due to scope changes"
    deadlineSet: "2025-05-15"
---
```

## Installation

1. Download `main.js` and `manifest.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/connradolisboa/status-logger/releases)
2. Create a folder `.obsidian/plugins/property-logs/` in your vault
3. Place both files in that folder
4. Reload Obsidian or restart it
5. Go to **Settings → Community Plugins** and enable **Property Logs**

Alternatively, install via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) (Obsidian plugin manager):

1. Install BRAT and enable it
2. Add the repository: `https://github.com/connradolisboa/status-logger`
3. Enable **Property Logs** in Community Plugins

## Configuration

### Settings Overview

Open **Settings → Property Logs** to configure three main sections: Filters, Behavior, and Chart Defaults.

#### Filters Tab

Control which notes the plugin monitors:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Included Folders** | Only track files in these folders. Leave empty to track all (unless excluded). You can specify paths like `Projects` or `Projects/Active`. |
| **Included Tags** | Only track files with these tags. Leave empty to track all (unless excluded). Tags are specified without the `#` symbol (e.g., `tracked`, `monitored`). |
| **Excluded Folders** | Never track files in these folders. Exclusions take priority over inclusions. |
| **Excluded Tags** | Never track files with these tags. Exclusions take priority over inclusions. |

**Examples:**
- Track only files in the `Projects` folder: Add `Projects` to Included Folders
- Track all files except archive: Add `Archive` to Excluded Folders
- Track files tagged with `tracked` and `important`: Add both to Included Tags
- Track everything except files tagged `no-log`: Add `no-log` to Excluded Tags

#### Behavior Tab

Customize logging behavior and property names:

##### Logging Options

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Overwrite same-day entries** | When enabled, only the latest change per day is kept (older changes the same day are replaced). Useful to avoid cluttering history with minor adjustments. |
| **Skip duplicate status** | When enabled, a status change is not logged if it matches the most recent entry. Prevents logging redundant state transitions. |

##### Property Keys

Customize the frontmatter keys used in history entries:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **History key** | `property_history` | The frontmatter array where all history entries are stored |
| **Date key** | `dateSet` | The field name used for the date within each history entry |
| **Status key** | `statusSet` | The field name used for the status value within each history entry |

Change these if your vault uses different naming conventions (e.g., use `timestamp` instead of `dateSet`).

##### Additional Tracked Properties

Beyond status, track any other frontmatter property. Specify:
- **Frontmatter key** — The property name in your note (e.g., `deadline`, `priority`, `assignee`)
- **History key** — The key to use in history entries (e.g., `deadlineSet`, `prioritySet`)

**Example:** To track deadline changes alongside status:
- Add Frontmatter key: `deadline`
- Add History key: `deadlineSet`

When the `deadline` property changes, it appears in the history entry:
```yaml
- dateSet: "2025-02-28"
  deadlineSet: "2025-05-15"
  comment: "Deadline extended"
```

#### Chart Defaults Tab

Pre-fill defaults when inserting charts. These are automatically updated each time you insert a chart with custom parameters.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default folder** | Folder path to filter pages by (e.g., `Projects`) |
| **Default tags** | Tags to filter pages by, comma-separated without `#` (e.g., `area, project`) |
| **Default period** | Time interval for chart X-axis: Week, Month, Quarter, or Year |
| **Default start date** | Start of the date range (`YYYY-MM-DD` format) |
| **Default end date** | End of the date range (`YYYY-MM-DD` format) |

## Commands

The plugin adds two commands (accessible via Ctrl/Cmd+P command palette):

### Insert Status Chart

Opens a modal to configure and insert a dataviewjs chart block.

**Parameters:**
- **Folder** — Filter pages by vault folder path (e.g., `Projects`). Leave blank for all folders.
- **Tags** — Filter pages by tags, comma-separated without `#` (e.g., `area, project`). Leave blank for all tags.
- **Period** — Time interval for the X-axis: Week, Month, Quarter, or Year
- **Start date** — Start of the date range (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- **End date** — End of the date range (`YYYY-MM-DD`)

The chart is inserted as a dataviewjs code block at your cursor position.

**Requirements:** [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [Obsidian Charts](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-charts) must be installed and enabled.

### Add Comment to Note

Opens a modal to add a timestamped comment to the current note's history.

Comments are logged to the same history entry as status changes on the same day (or create a new entry if no status change occurred). Useful for annotating why a status changed or adding context to a property change.

## Supported Status Values

The chart recognizes these standard status values. They map to numeric levels for visualization:

| Status | Level | Appearance |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Inactive, New, Cancelled | 1 | Circle marker |
| Backlog | 2 | — |
| Ongoing | 3 | — |
| Active | 4 | — |
| Done | 5 | — |

Use any other status values; they'll appear as blank on the chart but are still logged in history.

## Chart Behavior

- **Multi-line visualization** — Each note becomes a line on the chart, colored by its `color` frontmatter field
- **Supported colors** — Todoist color names (e.g., `blue`, `green`, `grape`, `red`, `orange`) or hex codes (e.g., `#FF5733`)
- **Baseline value** — Notes with no history yet show as `Inactive`
- **Future periods** — Notes created after a period's end don't appear for earlier periods
- **Shape markers** — Special point shapes distinguish Inactive (●), New (▲), and Cancelled (✕)
- **Time spanning** — Chart spans entire date range even if some notes have no data

## Examples

### Example 1: Track Project Status

Set up tracking for projects in the `Projects` folder:

1. Add `Projects` to **Included Folders** in settings
2. Add a `status` field to project notes: `status: Backlog`
3. Change the status as work progresses → The plugin logs each change automatically
4. Run **Insert Status Chart** and filter by folder `Projects` to visualize progress

### Example 2: Track Multiple Properties

Monitor both status and deadline for tasks:

1. In **Additional Tracked Properties**, add:
   - Frontmatter key: `deadline` → History key: `deadlineSet`
   - Frontmatter key: `priority` → History key: `prioritySet`
2. Add to your notes:
   ```yaml
   status: Backlog
   deadline: "2025-04-30"
   priority: P2
   ```
3. When either `deadline` or `priority` changes, both appear in the history:
   ```yaml
   - dateSet: "2025-02-28"
     statusSet: Active
     deadlineSet: "2025-05-15"
     prioritySet: P1
   ```

### Example 3: Selective Tracking

Track all project notes except archived ones:

1. Add `Projects` to **Included Folders**
2. Add `Archive` to **Excluded Folders**
3. Now only active project notes in `Projects` are tracked (excluding `Projects/Archive`)

### Example 4: Tag-Based Tracking

Track only notes tagged with `tracked`:

1. Add `tracked` to **Included Tags**
2. Leave folders empty
3. Only notes with the `tracked` tag will be monitored

Add the tag to any note you want to monitor, regardless of folder.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Separate concerns** — Use included folders for broad scoping (e.g., all projects) and tags for fine-grained control (e.g., only "high-visibility" projects)
- **Comments for context** — Use "Add comment to note" to annotate why a status changed for later review
- **Consolidate same-day changes** — Enable "Overwrite same-day entries" if you frequently adjust properties and only care about the final state per day
- **Chart filtering** — Always check the chart command's folder/tags to ensure you're visualizing the right subset of notes
- **Baseline stability** — The first time a property is seen becomes the baseline (not logged). Subsequent changes are logged. This prevents spurious entries when enabling tracking on an existing note

## How It Compares

| Feature | Property Logs | Obsidian Dataview | Obsidian Tasks |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Auto-log property changes | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Track any property | ✓ | ✗ | Partial |
| History per note | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Status timeline charts | ✓ | Manual queries | Task-only |
| Comments in history | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Configurable filtering | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

## Limitations

- Charts require [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [Obsidian Charts](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-charts) plugins
- Status values outside the standard set (Inactive, Backlog, Ongoing, Active, Done, etc.) won't be charted but are still logged
- Charts don't currently support filtering by multiple status values simultaneously
- Property changes are logged based on metadata cache updates; changes not reflected in the cache may not be detected

## Technical Details

- **Non-destructive** — All frontmatter edits use Obsidian's `processFrontMatter` API
- **Persistent state** — Baseline property values are saved to plugin data, so tracking state survives vault restarts
- **Metadata cache** — The plugin listens to metadata cache changes, so updates are instant within Obsidian
- **No external APIs** — All logging and charting happens locally in your vault
